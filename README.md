# Data Science Projects
The project is a collection of comprehensive data science projects focused on predictive analytics, where I applied machine learning techniques to solve both classification and regression problems. It serves as a demonstration of my ability to leverage data to make informed predictions and uncover insights. This project highlights my proficiency in handling real-world data challenges using machine learning algorithms, and it showcases my technical skills in data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

These projects were developed during my academic journey, and they reflect my commitment to mastering the tools and methodologies required to succeed in data science. If you're interested in exploring the project further or discussing its applications, I'd be happy to provide more details or answer any questions.
